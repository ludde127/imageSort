# imageSort
This program will sort images and videos and some other media formats using either
their metadata if that can be fetched and otherwise the program will default to using the last changed/acessed properties,
the minumum of those to fields will then be used as the creation time.

The files will be sorted into a format of Year/Month/Day/FILES, for example: \Year 2013\November\Day 9\"file.jpg".
The program is well optimized and is purely io limited even on fast ssd's.
